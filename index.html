      <p> Welcome to my site. My name is Claudia Gutarra and I am an up-and-coming
        web developer looking to take on new projects. I am currently completing a certification program in full
        stack web development at Rutgers University while interning at Holy Name Hospital's Creative IT
        department.
        I am constantly working on my coding skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Responsive Design. I also enjoy
        learning about the latest trends in UX/UI design to keep my websites looking fresh and up to date.
        <br><br>
        My main priority is making my client's vision come to life. I am passionate about creating responsive,
        intuitive, and dynamic websites.
        Please feel free to leave a message on my contact page for any more information!</p>
